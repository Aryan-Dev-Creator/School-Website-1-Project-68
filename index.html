            <p class="text-muted text-left">Ryan Group is the manifestation of dreams. It began as a vision to completely change the educational picture in the country and to make qualitative education available to all. From a small, simple beginning to one of the largest privately managed educational groups, Ryan Group has come a long way. The story of Ryan Group is that of complete dedication to the field, immense hardwork and an extreme desire for credible social change.

The foundation of this dream was laid in 1976 by Dr. Augustine F. Pinto, a graduate from the reputed Loyola College, Kolkata. The tremendous faith in the dream and the desire to succeed kept him going in spite of initial setbacks and challenges. It is his commitment, austerity and an ambitious approach to school education that has made him one of the most admired figures in the contemporary education sector.

In the contemporary scene, Ryan Group handles a widespread network of 128 schools across 18 states in the country. Without limiting the exposure, Ryan Group is working towards establishing its off-shoreschool campuses and has already a school in operation in the Middle East. The vision that started three decades earlier has now become one of a dire success story of our times.

Dr Augustine F Pinto attributes divine inspiration and guidance behind the spirit of his vision. According to him, "Forty years ago, God planted a seed in my heart and directed me to spread affordable, high quality English medium education within Indian society. Finally, our efforts, dedication and vision have helped us establish one of the largest chains of high quality education institutes in the country.</p>
